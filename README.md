# CS305-Final-Project

## Client Summary:
My client was Artimes Finnacial who were looking to update their software to be more secure for their various finnacial transactions.

## Importance of Security:
I did a good job following the security assement process and applying it to the client's needs. Secure coding is incredibly important in software development as there are many malicous actors in the world looking to gain access to systems and data for their own nefarious ends.

## Challenges:
Reviewing code for security vulernabilites manually was the biggest challenge.

## Increasing security:
I increased the security level of the application by adding the SHA-256 algorhtimic cipher and configuring the restFUL API to work over HTTPS rather than HTTP. In the future I will make sure to keep in mind the difference between HTTPS and HTTP when making paths for restFUL apps as well as the difference and importance of different ciphers.

## Ensuring security
After refactoring the code I ran the dependency check again as well as doing a manual code review, I also tested it in a local enviorment to ensure that it was only responding to HTTPS requests.

## Employer Benefit
From this project I can show a future employer that I'm famillar with HTTPS and encryption ciphers.
